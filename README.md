# Audio-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

• Developed a Neural Network Model to recognize Audio and classified it based on the sentiment through Bi-directional encoder representation of transformer architecture.

• Generation of waveforms and coefficients of audio had been done through Librosa.

• Evaluated model through recall score (87%) and precision (79%).

• Algorithms & Tools: Tensorflow, Keras, soundfile, librosa, sklearn.
